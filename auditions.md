## Come be a part of Cornell's original co-ed a cappella group!

At the beginning of each fall and spring semester, The Class Notes hold auditions
for all voice parts.

At the audition, you will:

* Sing **scales** (a test of range)
* Complete a **pitch matching** exercise.
* Perform a **short contemporary solo**, usually a verse and a chorus of
something that demonstrates just how talented you are. The best tip we can
offer you is to sing something in your range, e.g. if you're a bass, we want to
hear those rich bass notes. Please, no show tunes (we love Rodgers & Hammerstein,
and we hope they do not take offense to this rule).

That’s it! Typically, we have 2-3 days of open auditions, and then we have our
callbacks. We look forward to hearing you, and don’t hesitate to
[email our Musical Director](mailto:{{ site.data.cn.emails.md }}), Stef Wu '17,
with any questions.
