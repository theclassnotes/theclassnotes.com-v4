# The "New" Online Look of The Class Notes

Since our first website launched in 2003, our website has undergone three iterations. This
is the fourth, with a focus on simplicity, accessibility (to non-techies - much :heart:
for prose.io) and speed. Jekyll + GitHub Pages fits the bill from a technology standpoint,
and Eric's splendid design does an outstanding job with the content.
