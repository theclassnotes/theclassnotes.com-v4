**The Class Notes** is [Cornell University][]'s original co-ed a cappella group.
Founded in 1983, The Class Notes performs [a varied repertoire][] of contemporary
Pop, R&B, Rock and Hip-hop songs. Each semester, the group performs in Call
Auditorium for an audience of hundreds of fellow students.

The group is usually [comprised of 8 ladies and 8 gentlemen][], with voice ranges
from Bass to Soprano. Though a diverse group of Cornellians in many aspects,
the Notes are brought together by their love of music and performance (and
making an audience smile).

The Class Notes also [records studio albums][] every two or three years. Its
latest album is a 7-track EP called *Full Disclosure*, and is available on
to [buy on iTunes][] or to [stream on Spotify][]. One song from *Full
Disclosure*, *Best Thing I Never Had*, is featured on the *Contemporary A Cappella Society*'s 2013 *Voices
Only* compilation album and soloist Maya Gunaseharan was nominated for a CARA award for her performance.

In recent years, the Class Notes have made great strides, placing 1st in the 2012 [ICCA][] Quarterfinal of the Mid-Atlantic Region, with a bonus prize for best vocal percussion (Alex Martino) and best solo (Maya Guneseharan).
